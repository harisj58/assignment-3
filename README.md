### Description:
The project's main use is to obtain relevant information about the movie, including its rating and poster, based on the title which is to be inputted by the user. All the user has to do is to enter the desired movie title and hit the 'Get Movie' button to fetch the intended results. By default, the application displays the details of The Suicide Squad (2021) by James Gunn.

The project uses the OMDb API - The Open Movie Database (http://www.omdbapi.com/), a RESTful API, to obtain the movie information based on the title entered by the user.
The process of making this web application was highly simplified by the employment of ReactJS. The website is hosted at Heroku.
